Trying to remember everything that I forgot for this long dizzy break.
My first intensive (cheat a bit at 20.08.2020) since I changed university (6 months)
SpaceX template by Glo academy.

What I learned:
remembered main features of Html&CSS
how to use AOS (animation for .div)
add effect Shiny Glass Button Hover Effects

.list {
padding: 0;
margin: 0;
display: flex;
list-style: none; /* must have to remove 'points' on list */
}

Rellax - for parallax
vidbg - for insert video format(.mp4, .webm) which play forever
AOS - for animation .div
