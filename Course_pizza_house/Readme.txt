I had a template which I did before [asta-pizza]
the first project that I did by myself
It was the first site design of one designer(currently he's work at studio)
With his help in a few days I completed it

I got a course work, so I decided to improve it a bit, 
The fastest way was to took a finished template from the web and in a few days change it to my style.
This was the first time I've ever saw Bootstrap and multipage site as well.
My level JS still 0 (every idea I took is from template)
changelog:
- JS accordion(FAQs) 
- JS press button â‡¾ change type of food
- simple translation in stupid manner(change .html when press button)
